<p>Microsoft’s Corporate, External, and Legal Affairs (CELA) group, in partnership with the Office extensibility team, developed Matter Center for Office 365 -- a document management and collaboration solution built using the Office app development model, Azure and SharePoint. It takes advantage of the enterprise content management capabilities of the SharePoint platform, and offers many additional benefits through Add-ins in Outlook and Office (e.g., Word, PowerPoint). This allows the solution to quickly create, find, and store documents on predefined projects or matter sites. Matter Center takes advantage of the enterprise-grade cloud platform of Office 365 and Azure, so these productivity gains are realized while also reducing risk and cost. </p>

<h1>
<a id="contribution" class="anchor" href="#contribution" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Contribution</h1>

<p>This project was originated by the Microsoft Matter Center Engineering team. We wanted to build a solution to help our own legal professionals improve their productivity. Based on our conversations with many people in the industry, we decided to open source the project so others can use and enhance this solution.</p>

<p>We look forward to maturing the project with your help.</p>

<h3>
<a id="priorities" class="anchor" href="#priorities" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Priorities</h3>

<p>We have been working on this code for some time and know its many limitations. We created an initial list of <a href="PRIORITIES.md">priorities</a> that include architectural changes we’d love your help with. Together, we are excited to see these priorities realized and to continue adding to this list. </p>

<p>On December 17, 2015, we open sourced the project. We are thrilled to talk with as many contributors as possible to provide information and context:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>For bug fixes, we suggest simply creating an issue through GitHub and/or UserVoice in order to alert people and chat about the design of the fix.</p></li>
<li><p>Please try to make your pull request(s) as small as possible and be sure to keep your change close to master to avoid merge conflicts.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>For features, substantial code contributions, or interface changes, we would appreciate if you look first at the list of <a href="PRIORITIES.md">priorities</a> and announce your intention to work on a specific subject via the mailing list. This will allow for broader visibility, and maybe help find other people who already are working on that particular subject. </p>

<p>We would prefer initial work to be based on the priority list. Of course, if the priority list does not contain a specific subject you think is important, please help us identify new subjects and see how they fit in with the other priorities. There is some architectural work and refactoring that needs to happen first (as described in the priorities list) that will enable other work. Therefore, please discuss your suggestions on the mailing list to ensure it is an appropriate addition at this time. The committers will prioritize the list.</p>

<p>We encourage that you fork the repo if you’re planning to do substantial work. This lets you move forward at the pace you want and, when it comes time to submit a pull request, we’ll be able to refer to the fully working set of end to end code.</p>

<a id="additional-focus-areas" class="anchor" href="#additional-focus-areas" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Additional focus areas</h3>

<p>In addition to the priorities list, we bring Matter Center to GitHub with a wealth of existing feedback. Conversations with various communities has provided for a catalog of focus areas for us to consider as we move forward. </p>

<p>We have already pushed these ideas to <a href="http://mattercenter.uservoice.com">UserVoice</a> as well as to the <a href="https://github.com/Microsoft/mattercenter/issues">Issues list</a>. We encourage you to look to these two places.  </p>
